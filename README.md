# Prospecter

Search.py is just the google search with a prompt from the user in place of the query

New.py is a combination of search.py and a scraper and exports the file to csv
  I can't seem to merge the results of the URL pull from the search.py code to feed into the scraper
  
Emails.py is a seperate scraper that does much of the same of all the code in new.py but slightly differently and only based on one single url.

I want the final product to do what New.py is supposed to do, but I'm not sure whether the spider from New.py or from Emails.py is better

You'll also have to install the googlesearch package to run the search.py and new.py
